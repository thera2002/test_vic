This worked for me: sudo npm install -g npm@latest-6 Windows To obtain npm for Windows, you need to download the Windows version of node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ . You can download either the Windows Installer (.msi) or the Windows Binary (.zip). If you download and expand the Windows Binary zip file, you will afterwards need to set your PATH variable to include the directory that contains the npm executable (this directory is the subdirectory node_modules\\npm\\bin). Setting up npm (all platforms) The following step should be performed in the openlime directory that was cloned from this repository. Before using npm, you need to install the required packages locally. This only needs to be done once. The following command tells npm to download all the webpack packages (and their dependencies) listed in the package.json file. These will be put in the ./node_modules directory. npm install The downloaded packages include rollup, documentation, and nodemon, which will be used below. Using npm (all platforms) These steps should be performed in the openlime directory that was cloned from this repository. Build the code The following command reads the javascript code in ./src, and puts the transpiled webpack code in ./dist/main.js. npm run build The webpack code is used, for example, by the ./dist/index.html web page. Run the node.js server If you wish, you can run the node.js development server to serve your web pages. This server will use ./dist as the home directory. The server is run in \"hot\" mode, which means that whenever you change a file in the ./src directory, the webpack code will automatically be rebuilt, and your web browser will automatically refresh, to reflect your latest changes. npm run start Then access the demo app at http://localhost:8080 (which by default is ./dist/index.html). If you prefer to serve from a different port, say 8088, you can call npm run start -- --port 8088 Create a rollup file to use with other servers You do not need to use node.js as the server. Instead, you can use the &lt;script&gt; approach, embedding a rollup file, either ./build/openlime.min.js or ./build/openlime.js, in your web page. The files ./dist/ui_custom.html and ./dist/ui_svg.html are examples of this approach. Such files will display correctly when served from any web server. To create the rollup files, call rollup: npm run rollup Keep the rollup files up to date If you keep a nodemon (node monitor) script running, it will automatically update the rollup files ./build/openlime.min.js and ./build/openlime.js whenever anything changes in the ./src directory. Note that, unlike with the node.js server, the browser will not refresh automatically; you will have to do that yourself once the rollup files have been updated. npm run nodemon Create documentation The documentation is created from structured comments in the source code (in ./src). Once created, it is accessible from ./docs/index.html npm run documentation Customization skin.css skin.svg Run svgo -p 1 skin.svg -o skin.min.svg to minimize svg. Documentation.js supports markdown syntax and JSDoc syntax.
